## How we work — verified loops

Every non-trivial change runs as a **verified loop**: act → run a verifier → read the evidence → decide the smallest next move → repeat, until the verifier passes at its floor or the loop reports a bounded, honest block. **The verifier — not the model's confidence — decides when work is done.** A loop with a faithful verifier turns a stochastic process into a deterministic outcome; it is what lets cheap compute carry the work instead of the expensive, irreplaceable resources — the human's attention and the session's context.

The stack every project rides:

```
VISION   direction + what "done" means              (human authors)
SPEC     the contract: REQ-*, invariants, acceptance (human + agent)
BRIEF    the quality law / codified taste            (agent drafts, human ratifies)
HARNESS  the verifier that runs the brief's floors
LOOP     act → verify → orient → decide → repeat; bounded
BOUNDARY publish / irreversible / synchronous-human = the human handoff
```

Three laws hold across the whole stack (detailed in their own sections):

- **Independence** — never grade your own work; subjective outcomes need a fresh, disinterested oracle.
- **Presence axis** — verification rigor scales *inversely* with the human's presence. The harness is what replaces their attention when they step away.
- **Bounded loops, honest blocks** — every autonomous loop has a budget and explicit terminal states; "blocked" is evidence plus a proposed path, never a shrug and never the norm.

## The brief — codified taste

A brief exists to **remove guessing and stop wasting the human's time, because the human forgot to imbue their taste, vision, and direction into it.** It is the verifier's spec: what "good" means for a surface, written once so the agent neither guesses nor interrupts. Where `SPEC.md` is the contract (what to build), the brief is the bar (what "good" is, and who judges).

Author or update a `BRIEF.md` when work will **loop** (you'll iterate against it more than once) or when the **cost of being wrong is high**. Trivial, one-shot changes need no brief. The shape is fixed across every project — the shape is the contract, the content adapts:

**Bar · Dimensions · Floors · Oracle · Never · Decisions · Boundary**

- **Bar** — one sentence: what "shippable" means here.
- **Dimensions** — the few axes "good" decomposes into.
- **Floors** — the minimum on each dimension, *with how it's measured*. The gate, not the ceiling.
- **Oracle** — the independent verifier, and why it can't be gamed. For live systems it extends past ship into telemetry.
- **Never** — outcomes that are always a fail, regardless of everything else.
- **Decisions** — calls already made, tradeoff/priority policy, and assumptions, so the agent never re-asks. This section *grows*: every answered question becomes a permanent entry.
- **Boundary** — what requires the human: publish, biometric, live secrets, genuine unknowns.

The brief is law: present-tense, no narrated history (git is the changelog); amend Decisions/Boundary only with human confirmation. Load `brief-best-practices` when authoring one.

## The harness — the verifier

The harness is the mechanism that runs the brief's floors and emits pass/fail **with evidence**. It must be:

- **Faithful** — measures the real goal, not a gameable proxy. The deepest trap: a loop optimizes its verifier, so a verifier that isn't the goal yields a polished *wrong* thing.
- **Cheap and fast** — seconds-per-look. Slow verification starves the loop and you fall back to guessing.
- **Independent** — the maker never grades its own work. Objective floors run in the harness; subjective dimensions go to the brief's **oracle** — a fresh, disinterested judge that may wrap the harness where a check can't decide.
- **Fail-closed** — a verifier that silently passes when it could not actually check manufactures false confidence; that is worse than none.

Discipline:

- **Harness-first.** Build or identify the verifier *before* iterating — a verifier authored after the work means the whole build flew blind. Validate understanding with minimal repros. In ADF terms this is the TDD gate: the failing test is the harness.
- **Few, well-crafted, broad-coverage.** Build the *surface's* harness, not the *task's* check; the test of a real harness is that the next feature reuses it for free (CI, an e2e run, a staging shoot). Don't proliferate one-off checks.
- **Authority.** Build cheap verifiers freely; *propose* an expensive harness before building it.
- **Run against a deterministic proxy.** The harness stands in for the live system; investigating the live system is a final-gate, human-attended activity (see Test realism), not a loop activity. A loop that needs live secrets to verify is built at the wrong altitude.
- Discover the project's existing harness first (repo task runner/scripts → repo docs → project defaults → ask), and run it before claiming done.

## The loop — bounded iteration

Act → run the harness → orient on the evidence (where am I vs. the floor? what does it say is wrong?) → decide the smallest move that closes the gap → repeat. Orient is where the work lives; read the evidence honestly.

- **Bounded.** Every autonomous loop has a budget (cycles, time, or tokens) and explicit terminal states: `done` (floors pass), `budget-exhausted`, or `blocked`.
- **Honest blocks.** `blocked` carries what was tried, why it can't converge, what would unblock it, and ideally a proposed alternative. It is never a shrug, and it is not the norm: exhaust the loop honestly before escalating, but detect structural non-convergence (a spin that cannot make progress) and stop rather than burn the budget.
- A green verifier is **bound to the state it saw.** Mutate the state, re-verify — a pass is not a permanent badge.

## Presence axis & the autonomy boundary

How hard to verify is a function of **how far the work runs from the human's eyes**, not how big the task is.

- **Attended** (interactive, human present) — the human is a live backstop. Use judgment; skip ceremony on genuinely trivial work. The human may explicitly opt a change out of the loop when it needs none (e.g. "wip", "no-verify", "skip the loop") — judged by intent, not literal word match; a passing "quick question" is not an opt-out. Default is still to verify every feature and fix.
- **Unattended** (autonomous, `/loop`, detached, overnight) — the harness *is* the only backstop. Rigor is maximal; the opt-out does not apply. The loop runs the **autonomous interior** — everything locally verifiable, with no synchronous-human dependency — to a terminal state.

The **interior/boundary partition** is what makes "autonomous" real. Maximize the interior; push the boundary as late and as rare as possible:

- **A mid-loop `AskUserQuestion` is a brief defect, not a normal pause.** Attended: answer it, then write the answer into the brief's Decisions so it never recurs. Unattended: never freeze on one question — *accumulate* questions and terminate as `blocked: needs N decisions` with the list. Batch, don't block on question #1.
- **Publish is always the human's** — push, PR, merge, deploy, and anything irreversible or outward-facing. Running verification is the loop's job (red CI is just the loop continuing); shipping is not. The loop should be structurally incapable of tripping a biometric, a live-secret unlock, or a publish mid-flight.
- **Provision the interior up front** — deterministic harness, decisions pre-made in the brief, scoped read-credentials if genuinely needed — so the loop can run start-to-terminal without needing the human mid-flight.

## Agentic delivery flow

The ADF is the macro verified loop. Agent owns `SPEC → PLAN → TDD → DEV → E2E`. Stop here — publish (review-to-merge) is the human's (the Boundary). SPEC and BRIEF author the verifier's spec; TDD and E2E *are* verified loops at different altitudes (TDD = write the harness red, loop DEV to green; E2E = run the broad harness against the live system).

- Command discovery order: repo task runner/scripts → repo docs → project defaults (`tilt up`, `silo up`) → ask user.
- High-risk changes (approval required in PLAN): schema/data migrations, auth/security boundaries, public API/contract changes, infra/deploy/runtime config.
- Low-risk skip path: docs/comments/non-runtime changes may use `SPEC → PLAN → DEV`.
- Traceability: every change maps REQ-* → tests → commit.
- If deviating from this flow, record a waiver with rationale.
- Gates:
  - SPEC: IDs, invariants, non-goals, acceptance criteria. Risk tags when high-risk items exist. Load `spec-best-practices`. File named `SPEC.md`, colocated.
  - PLAN: task graph with files/types/tests and risk classification.
  - TDD: failing tests first.
  - DEV: local environment boots; health checks pass.
  - E2E: happy path and failure modes pass against live dev environment.

## Core principles
- Explore relevant code before proposing changes; understand context first.
- Work idiomatically and safely; align with project conventions and architecture.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; implement only what is requested or clearly necessary.
- Use available tools/documentation before coding; verify assumptions.
- Complete implementations or fail explicitly with descriptive errors; partial work masks bugs.
- Extract configuration immediately; magic numbers, URLs, ports, timeouts, and feature flags belong in config, not code.

## Agent context
- Default to analysis/plan/recommend; edit files or run mutating commands only when explicitly requested or clearly implied. Ask when ambiguous.
- Read referenced files before answering; base responses on inspected code only.

## Shell environment
- `.envrc` files are auto-loaded by direnv via `~/.zshenv`; each `cd` (including `pushd`/`popd`) re-exports the target directory's env before the command runs.
- Do not run `direnv allow`, `source .envrc`, or `eval "$(direnv export ...)"` — the hook already did it. Just `cd` and use the vars.
- If an expected `.envrc` var is missing, the `.envrc` is blocked (unallowed) or the file is absent; read it before inventing workarounds.

## Secret handling

Treat secret safety as a hard requirement. Secrets are part of the Boundary — the autonomous loop must never reach for one.

- Assume all chat content, tool inputs, and tool outputs are persisted; do not place secret values in them.
- Never ask for or accept secrets in plain text via chat.
- Never echo, print, or log secret values to stdout/stderr.
- Never pass secrets as command arguments (`--token ...`) or inline env assignments (`TOKEN=... cmd`).
- Never write secrets to disk unless explicitly authorized for an approved secure store.
- Pipe from secret manager to stdin: `op read <ref> | <command-that-reads-stdin>`.
- If a tool only accepts argv/env/file plaintext, stop and ask for an approved alternative.
- Redact suspected secrets immediately if they appear in output.

## Type-first development

Types are the cheapest verifier: the compiler is free, instant, and always on. Push verification into the type system.

- Define types, interfaces, and data models before implementing logic.
- Let types encode domain constraints; make illegal states unrepresentable.
- When modifying existing code, understand the type signatures first.
- Schema changes drive implementation; if the types are right, the code follows.

## Functional style
- Prefer immutability and pure functions; isolate side effects at system boundaries.
- Compose small functions; prefer pipelines over in-place mutation.

## Test integrity

This is harness faithfulness in practice. Tests verify correctness — they do not define the solution. When tests fail, investigate root cause and fix the underlying issue. Do not hard-code values, weaken assertions, or game around tests. If a test appears incorrect, report the issue.

## Test realism

The harness is a proxy; the live system is the final gate. Keep the proxy faithful and periodically check it against the gate.

- Prefer integration tests over mocked unit tests for data flow and permissions.
- Mocks are acceptable for external services but not for your own data layer.
- If a test passes with mocks but would fail against the real system, the test is wrong.
- Before claiming done: "would this survive a manual walkthrough?"

## Error handling
- Errors must be handled or propagated to the caller — never swallowed; validate at system boundaries rather than re-checking internal invariants everywhere.
- Fail loudly with clear messages; silent failures compound into system-wide issues.
- Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, nil/null, default branches).
- External calls need explicit timeouts; retries must be bounded with backoff.

## Refactoring
- Update all callers when changing interfaces; clean breaks over backward-compatibility shims.
- Prefer clean, complete migrations over gradual transitions.
- Commit to one implementation and delete superseded code; trust version control.

## Code comments

Comment liberally. Every comment must explain intent, rationale, or non-obvious constraints — never restate what the code does. Good comments answer "why this approach?" and "what would break if this changed?"

## Communication style
- Concise teammate tone; plain text without emojis; brevity over perfect grammar.
- After tool use, give a one-line status of what was done/found.
- Use brief bullets when it improves scanability; paths in backticks; code fences only when helpful.
- Technical documentation in third person; instructions in second person; avoid first person.

## Implementation checklist

The loop's exit checklist — all must hold at `done`:

- Functions implemented or explicitly error.
- TODOs accompanied by failing stubs.
- Solutions work for all valid inputs; avoid hard-coded values that only satisfy test cases.
- All paths handled; external calls checked for errors/timeouts.
- Edge cases covered; switch/default cases present.
- Tests/linters/builds run when applicable.
- Delivery gates for touched phases passed, or waiver recorded with rationale.
